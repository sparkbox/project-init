The test suite tests every feature. It doesn't cater to specific\naspects.\n\nBenchmarks for other engines to come (?).\n\n## Install\n\n``` bash\n$ npm install marked\n```\n\n## Another javascript markdown parser\n\nThe point of marked was to create a markdown compiler where it was possible to\nfrequently parse huge chunks of markdown without having to worry about\ncaching the compiled output somehow...or blocking for an unnecesarily long time.\n\nmarked is very concise and still implements all markdown features. It is also\nnow fully compatible with the client-side.\n\nmarked more or less passes the official markdown test suite in its\nentirety. This is important because a surprising number of markdown compilers\ncannot pass more than a few tests. It was very difficult to get marked as\ncompliant as it is. It could have cut corners in several areas for the sake\nof performance, but did not in order to be exactly what you expect in terms\nof a markdown rendering. In fact, this is why marked could be considered at a\ndisadvantage in the benchmarks above.\n\nAlong with implementing every markdown feature, marked also implements\n[GFM features](http://github.github.com/github-flavored-markdown/).\n\n## Usage\n\n``` js\nvar marked = require('marked');\nconsole.log(marked('i am using __markdown__.'));\n```\n\nYou also have direct access to the lexer and parser if you so desire.\n\n``` js\nvar tokens = marked.lexer(str);\nconsole.log(marked.parser(tokens));\n```\n\n``` bash\n$ node\n> require('marked').lexer('> i am using marked.')\n[ { type: 'blockquote_start' },\n  { type: 'text', text: ' i am using marked.' },\n  { type: 'blockquote_end' },\n  links: {} ]\n```\n\n## CLI\n\n``` bash\n$ marked -o hello.html\nhello world\n^D\n$ cat hello.html\n<p>hello world</p>\n```\n\n## Syntax Highlighting\n\nMarked has an interface that allows for a syntax highlighter to highlight code\nblocks before they're output.\n\nExample implementation:\n\n``` js\nvar highlight = require('my-syntax-highlighter')\n  , marked_ = require('marked');\n\nvar marked = function(text) {\n  var tokens = marked_.lexer(text)\n    , l = tokens.length\n    , i = 0\n    , token;\n\n  for (; i < l; i++) {\n    token = tokens[i];\n    if (token.type === 'code') {\n      token.text = highlight(token.text, token.lang);\n      // marked should not escape this\n      token.escaped = true;\n    }\n  }\n\n  text = marked_.parser(tokens);\n\n  return text;\n};\n\nmodule.exports = marked;\n```\n\n## License\n\nCopyright (c) 2011-2012, Christopher Jeffrey.
